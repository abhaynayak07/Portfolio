                <p>
                  Q Easy is a queue management solution designed to solve the
                  problem of long queues in Indian public spaces like government
                  offices, hospitals, post offices, and railway stations. The
                  app enables users to book digital tokens remotely and view
                  real-time updates on queue position and estimated wait time.
                  Special provisions are made for senior citizens, pregnant
                  women, and those with disabilities.

                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                <p>
                  Key takeaways from this project include understanding that
                  real UX impact comes from solving everyday user frustrations,
                  not just visual polish. I learned how small, thoughtful
                  features like reminders and token sharing can significantly
                  improve accessibility. Designing for inclusivity, like
                  prioritizing seniors or pregnant users adds real value. Most
                  importantly, I realized that empathetic design can bridge the
                  gap between public systems and peopleâ€™s real needs.

            <h3>The Journey</h3>
            <p>
              Journey began with observing the struggles people face in long
              queues at government offices and public places in India. I focused
              on identifying pain points, especially for those with physical
              limitations or time constraints. Through iterative wireframing and
              feedback, I crafted a user flow that felt simple yet powerful.
              This project reminded me how meaningful design emerges when
              empathy meets functionality.
